# Molnet_IOT

Hello Folks,

In this project we are planning to collect data from Molenet model through the RF wireless receiver. The Molnet  is burried under the soil  and sensors attached to the molenet sense the data such as temprature,water content etc. This data is being transmitted by the Molnet module in RF frequncy to the outside world.

Our vision is to collect this data most cost effective way(in terms of energy cost, user-friendliness, complexity in implementation etc.). Also plot or display the data in end device (tablet or mobile).
